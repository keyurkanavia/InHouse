		<div id="content">Multiplus Fidelidade, our new business unit, and Oracle have signed a contract to implement the technological platform using the Oracle Siebel Call Center and Oracle Siebel CRM Loyalty solutions, which will link the loyalty programs of companies representing diverse industries – from an airline company to gas stations, phone companies, supermarkets, hotels, bookstores, movie theaters, banks, credit cards, internet service providers, automobile manufacturers, and more – and integrate them into a network of loyalty initiative programs.

“We decided to invest in a top quality global technology that has been proven to have the flexibility and versatility to efficiently manage the network of Multiplus Fidelidade programs, which has several companies across different industries as members, and each one of them with their own regulations,” states Líbano Barroso, our Vice President of Finances, Management and IT, explaining the reasons that led them to choose the Oracle platform. He adds that another decisive factor was the platform’s scalability; it is able to handle the fast, strong growth expected as partners join the program and consumers become Multiplus Fidelidade members.

The Multiplus Fidelidade Operations Director, Luiz Eduardo Ritzmann, confirms that the technologies of 13 companies that participated in the selection process were evaluated, requiring the analysis of 110 technical requirements. “We came to the conclusion that the loyalty programs platform developed by Oracle with globally proven effectiveness, including those developed for airline companies, is the most appropriate due to its flexibility, which allows the connectivity of all programs belonging to the Multiplus Fidelidade network,” he says. Oracle’s global operation was another relevant attribute, considering that in the first quarter of 2010 we will complete the membership process with the Star Alliance, the largest global commercial aviation alliance.

This flexibility will allow Multiplus Fidelidade members to concentrate on a single points account that will accumulate with airline ticket purchases as well as daily spending with gas stations, cell phone companies, supermarkets and bookstores that participate in the network, as well as companies in other industries. Consumers may access Multiplus Fidelidade via the internet to redeem accumulated points for rewards offered by the participating companies’ loyalty programs – from TAM Viagens tours to products and services from the other partners.
